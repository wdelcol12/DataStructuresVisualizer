# DataStructuresVisualizer
Data Structure Visualizer is a personal project that was used during my tutoring sessions to help students better understand the process behind deletion, traversal, and reversing with tkinter in python. The program allows for the user to display linkedlist nodes and highlights the variables as well as the standard c++ code that is used for linked list algorithms. The idea is to help student visualize and better understand pointers and linked lists targeted towards visual learners
